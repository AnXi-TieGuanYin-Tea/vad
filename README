This is the code project for my Master of Engineering by research at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore). Feel free to use it as-is, I can't provide any help since it has been a while; debugging is your friend.

I don't claim ownership of several scripts that I found around the Internet. Feel free to use them at your own risk. If you're the owner of these scripts and would like to take them off this repo, please drop me a message. Thank you.
